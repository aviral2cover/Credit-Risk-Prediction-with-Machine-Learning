        "\n",
        "Before we begin our modelling, let me explain how the system works. Banks build a method to match borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors that are willing to lend money in hopes of returns from the interest. Each borrower fills out an application with details about their financial history. The bank then evaluates the borrowers application and assign an interest rate to the borrower. \n",
        "\n",
        "Some marketplaces match borrowers that are seeking a loan with investors that are willing to invest to make profits on interests. Banks charge a higher interest rate to the borrowers who seem to be riskier investments. They have their own criteria for deciding the interest rate. However over the years, many fintech companies have adopted **Machine Learning** to do the job. \n",
        "\n",
        "We will be building one such model of our own to demonstrate a complete Machine Learning pipeline, including data cleaning, feature selections and choosing algorithms. \n",
        "\n",
        "##Objective##\n",
        "\n",
        "To build a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time. \n",

        "##Dataset##\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset that we're going to use is from a marketplace called 'Lending Club'. They release data on all their approved and declined loan aplications. The dataset contains information about the approved loans, \n",
        "\n",
        "##Assumptions##\n",
        "\n",
        "We need to keep in mind that in a situation where commodity or money is involved, it is usually prudent to have a conservative approach to building Machine Learning algorithms, in order to minimizing risk of incurring losses. The other strategy is to make several investments ranging from low to high risk returns. \n",
        "\n",
        "I have designed this model from the perspecrive of a conservative investor willing to invest in safe options. \n",
