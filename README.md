# Credit-Risk-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
I built an end-to-end Machine Learning model to demonstrate a complete Machine Learning pipeline, including data cleaning, feature selections and choosing algorithms. The primary objective of the project is to accurately predict who amongst all the clients are likely to default on the loan payment. I performed a thorough data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and then finally trained the model on Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
